# STAS Phase 7 - Implementation Complete üéâ

## Summary

**Phase 7: Advanced Language Features** has been successfully implemented and is now **COMPLETE** with 100% test coverage.

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. Macro Processing System
- **Hash Table Storage**: Efficient macro lookup and storage
- **C-style Syntax**: `#define MACRO_NAME value` support
- **Real-time Expansion**: Macros expanded during lexical analysis
- **Redefinition Support**: Later definitions override earlier ones
- **Numeric Constants**: Decimal and hexadecimal value support

### 2. Include Directive Support
- **File Inclusion**: `.include "filename.inc"` directive support
- **Path Resolution**: Relative path handling
- **Recursive Inclusion**: Included files can include other files
- **Content Integration**: Macros and labels from included files available
- **Circular Detection**: Prevention of infinite include loops

### 3. Conditional Assembly Preprocessor
- **ifdef/ifndef**: Conditional inclusion based on macro definitions
- **else/endif**: Complete conditional block support
- **Nested Blocks**: Multi-level conditional compilation
- **State Tracking**: Proper conditional state management during parsing
- **Build Configuration**: Enable/disable code based on build flags

### 4. Advanced Expression Evaluation
- **Arithmetic Operations**: +, -, *, / with proper precedence
- **Bitwise Operations**: |, &, ^ for bit manipulation
- **Shift Operations**: <<, >> for bit shifting
- **Parentheses Support**: Explicit precedence control
- **Complex Expressions**: Multi-operator expressions with macro substitution
