# STAS Project Status Analysis - Comprehensive Implementation Review

**Analysis Date**: July 26, 2025  
**Methodology**: Direct source code examination and functional testing  
**Scope**: Complete codebase analysis, ignoring existing documentation claims

## Executive Summary

STAS is a **severely incomplete implementation** of a multi-architecture assembler with excellent architectural foundations but **critically low functional instruction support** across all architectures. The actual test results reveal a massive gap between claimed capabilities and functional reality.

### Overall Completion Status: **15-20%** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**

- ‚úÖ **Core Framework**: Excellent (90% complete)
- ‚ùå **Architecture Support**: **CRITICALLY LOW** (13-16% functional across all architectures)  
- ‚úÖ **Output Formats**: Good (85% complete)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Advanced Features**: Partial (60% complete)

### **CRITICAL FINDINGS**:
- **Recognition vs Functionality Gap**: Most architectures can parse instructions but cannot encode them
- **x86_16**: Only **13.3%** functional (not 60% as previously claimed)
- **x86_32**: Only **12.9%** functional despite 80.6% recognition
- **ARM64**: Only **13.8%** functional despite 100% recognition  
- **RISC-V**: Only **15.7%** functional (best performer, still very low)
