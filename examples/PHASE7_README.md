# Phase 7: Advanced Language Features - COMPLETE

This directory demonstrates all Phase 7 features of the STAS assembler:

## 1. Macro Processing ✅
- C-style `#define` macros with and without parameters
- Automatic macro expansion in immediate values and symbols
- Support for hex, decimal, and string macro values

Example:
```assembly
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
#define DEBUG_VALUE 0xDEADBEEF
movq $BUFFER_SIZE, %rax      # Expands to movq $1024, %rax
movq $DEBUG_VALUE, %rbx     # Expands to movq $0xDEADBEEF, %rbx
```

## 2. Include Directives ✅
- Support for `.include "filename"` directives
- File inclusion with proper path resolution
- Shared macro and symbol namespaces across included files

Example:
```assembly
.include "common_defs.inc"   # Includes macro definitions
movq $INCLUDED_MACRO, %rax   # Uses macro from included file
```

## 3. Conditional Assembly ✅
- `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#else`, `#endif` preprocessor directives
- Conditional compilation based on macro definitions
- Proper nesting and state management

Example:
```assembly
#define RELEASE_BUILD
#ifdef RELEASE_BUILD
    movq $0x12345678, %rax   # Only included in release builds
#else
    movq $0xDEADBEEF, %rax   # Only included in debug builds  
#endif
```

## 4. Advanced Expressions ✅
- Complex constant expression evaluation
- Symbol arithmetic and macro expansion
- Operator precedence parsing

Example:
```assembly
#define BASE 0x1000
#define OFFSET 0x100
movq $(BASE + OFFSET), %rax  # Complex expression evaluation
```

## Test Files:
- `phase7_complete_demo.s` - Comprehensive demonstration of all features
- `common_defs.inc` - Example include file with macro definitions

## Verification:
All Phase 7 features have been implemented and tested successfully. The assembler now supports:
- Complete macro preprocessing with expansion
- File inclusion system with proper path resolution  
- Full conditional compilation preprocessor
- Advanced expression evaluation with operator precedence

**Status: PHASE 7 COMPLETE ✅**
