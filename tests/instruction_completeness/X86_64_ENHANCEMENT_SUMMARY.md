  7. **String Operations** (30 instructions): movs, cmps, scas, lods, stos with repeat prefixes
  8. **I/O Instructions** (16 instructions): in, out, ins, outs with port operations
  9. **Flag Control** (15 instructions): clc, stc, cli, sti, pushf, popf, etc.
  10. **System Instructions** (50 instructions): syscall, cpuid, msr, vmx, cache control, etc.

### 2. Detailed Operand Specifications
Each instruction includes comprehensive operand type information:
- **Register operands**: r8, r16, r32, r64 (general purpose registers)
- **Memory operands**: r/m8, r/m16, r/m32, r/m64 (register or memory)
- **Immediate operands**: imm8, imm16, imm32 (immediate values)
- **Relative operands**: rel8, rel16, rel32 (relative addresses for jumps)
- **Specific registers**: AL, AX, EAX, RAX, CL, DX, etc. (fixed register constraints)
- **Memory addressing**: Complex addressing modes and memory operand sizes

### 3. External Authoritative Source
- **Intel Software Developer's Manual** as the primary reference
- **Comprehensive coverage** of x86_64 instruction set architecture
- **Modern instruction support** including BMI/BMI2, security features, virtualization

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Definition Structure
```c
// Example: Enhanced instruction with detailed operand specification
{"add", "Arithmetic", 2, false},  // r/m8,r8 | r/m16,r16 | r/m32,r32 | r/m64,r64 | 
                                  // r8,r/m8 | r16,r/m16 | r32,r/m32 | r64,r/m64 | 
                                  // r/m8,imm8 | r/m16,imm16 | r/m32,imm32 | r/m64,imm32 | 
                                  // AL,imm8 | AX,imm16 | EAX,imm32 | RAX,imm32
```

### Build System Integration
- **Proper directory structure**: obj/tests/instruction_completeness/, testbin/
- **Main Makefile integration**: `make test-instruction-completeness`
- **Standalone operation**: Direct modular Makefile execution
- **Clean build artifacts**: Organized object and executable placement

## Future Development Opportunities

### High Priority
1. **Floating-Point Instructions**: SSE, AVX, x87 instruction sets
2. **Advanced Extensions**: AVX-512, Intel CET, MPX instructions
3. **Operand Detail Enhancement**: Specific addressing mode validation
4. **Implementation Gaps**: String operations, bit manipulation, I/O instructions

### Medium Priority
1. **Instruction Encoding**: Detailed opcode and encoding validation
2. **Cross-Reference**: Link instruction definitions to STAS implementation
3. **Performance Analysis**: Instruction usage statistics and optimization targets
4. **Documentation**: Intel manual cross-references and implementation notes

## Files Modified/Created

### Enhanced Files
- `tests/instruction_completeness/arch_x86_64.c`: Comprehensive instruction definitions
- `tests/instruction_completeness/arch_x86_64.h`: Updated interface
- `Makefile`: Integrated modular instruction completeness system

### Build System
- `tests/instruction_completeness/Makefile_modular`: Clean, maintainable build
- Proper object file organization in `obj/tests/instruction_completeness/`
- Executable placement in `testbin/`

## Verification and Testing

### Successful Integration Tests
